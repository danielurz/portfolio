        learning HTML, CSS & Js as a Hobbie but ended up liking it and started
        doing websites for friends and family.

        Last year meanwhile i was working as a call center agent in an US company 
        assisting Uber drivers i was studying React and making projects at the same 
        time just in order for me to get enough experience and knowledge to get

        text: `I always do my best to exceed expectations in everything I do, including 
        this dev journey I got myself into, I always try to do the best I can in
        the shortest time possible, I have never liked to do mediocre jobs,
        everything needs to be perfect or I am not confortable with the outcome, I 
        am very meticulous with details.
        <br/><br/>
        You can clearly see that in all the projects below I have made, I always 
        make sure everything fits perfectly, the UI and the UX, on top of that it
        needs to look and feel good in every device it's been displayed, that's 
        vital.`
