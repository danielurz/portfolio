                                        learning HTML, CSS & Js as a Hobbie but ended up liking it and starded

                                        Last year meanwhile i was working as a call center agent in an US company 
                                        asisting Uber drivers i was studyng React and making projects at the same 
                                        time just in order for me to get enough experience and knowledge to get

                                        I always do my best to exceed expectations in everything i do, including 
                                        this dev journey i got myself into, i always try to do the best i can in
                                        the shortest time possible, i have never liked to do mediocre jobs,
                                        everything needs to be perfect or i am not confortable with the outcome, i 
                                        am very meticulous with details.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        You can clearly see that in all the projects below i have made, i always 
                                        make sure everything fits perfecly, the UI and the UX, in top of that it
                                        needs to look and feel good in every device it's been displayed, that's 
                                        vital. This portfolio is also made all by myself from scratch 
                                        because  i wanted to give a great impression <br/><br/>
                                        So i really believe that my sense of work, responsability, effectiveness 
                                        and efficiency could be benefitial to any dev company i'd start working 
                                        with .
